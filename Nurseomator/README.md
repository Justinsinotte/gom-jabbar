Test Test Justin Tech Test for PHA

frontend: npx create-react-app client do this in root folder

npm install leaflet-defaulticon-compatibility --save
npm install socket.io-client leaflet react-leaflet

cd client and yarn install

backend: yard init and skip everything
yarn add node nodemon dotenv mongodb express morgan socket.io cors

Notice I put gitignore's everywhere JUST in case someone yarn installs in the root or another folder.

Bugs: Cooldown seems to work for all the nurses at this point and starts when the server starts which is weird but I decided to move on to the next task for now.
